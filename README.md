# BQN for Racket
BQN.rkt is a BQN compiler written in Racket capable of converting (some) BQN code into native Racket syntax. 
While it's still too early in development to even call an alpha product, it can at least function as a rough proof of concept,
and even already has some novelties such as complex arithmetic.
